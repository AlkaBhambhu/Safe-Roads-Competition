Question:
1. Interaction terms b/w variables - for e.g. light and hour/time
2. pilot models testing few predictors at a time.
3. Use nbviewer to view interactive notebooks. Simply plug in the URL of the notebook from github.
https://nbviewer.org/
4. This query waS used to generate the Road Impediments dataset 
SELECT ROUND(Latitude, 3) As Latitude, ROUND(Longitude, 3) as Longitude, AVG(PercentOfVehicles) as PercentOfVehicles, 
AVG(AvgAcceleration) as AvgAcceleration, AVG(PercentCar) as PercentCar, AVG(PercentMPV) as PercentMPV, AVG(PercentLDT) as PercentLDT, AVG(PercentMDT) as PercentMDT, AVG(PercentHDT) as PercentHDT, AVG(PercentOther) as PercentOther
FROM `geotab-public-intelligence.UrbanInfrastructure.RoadImpediments`
WHERE City = 'Toronto'
GROUP BY ROUND(Latitude, 3), ROUND(Longitude, 3);
5. Data is being counted for long and lat rounded to 3 decimal places, because if it is done for the EXACT location of accidents 
we will have a very sparse dataset.
6. Use this to show the truncate/round to 3 degrees decision.

7. For the Heatmap, use this to compare traffic safety measures put in place:

Total - 16,860 
Kids (0-19) - 1164 records
0-14 - 398 records [254 passengers, 120 pedestrians(injury either fatal or major)]
There is a school in every neighbourhood.

#Clustering Notes 
Cluster-2 (1227 accidents)
Mode = MANOEUVER	DRIVACT	DRIVCOND	TRAFFCTL	SPEEDING	ALCOHOL	REDLIGHT	AG_DRIV
     	Going Ahead	Driving Properly	Normal	No Control	<Null>	<Null>	<Null>	<Null>

- 50% of accidents were pedestrian collisions(624) due to crossing at mid-blocks(390) or intersection(226) at NO-TRAFFIC CONTROL
Maximum accidents at yonge street, dundas, BATHURST
so basically pedestrians at fault. 

Cluster - 0 (750 accidents)
Mode = MANOEUVER	DRIVACT	DRIVCOND	TRAFFCTL	SPEEDING	ALCOHOL	REDLIGHT	AG_DRIV
       Going Ahead	Driving Properly	Normal	Traffic Signal	<Null>	<Null>	<Null>	<Null>
- AGAIN 50% of accidents were pedestrian collisions(360) due to Crossing without right of way (204) 
other impact type were cyclist collisions & turning movement 

Cluster - 3 (559)
Mode Cluster. MANOEUVER	      DRIVACT	                     DRIVCOND.    	TRAFFCTL	SPEEDING	ALCOHOL	REDLIGHT	AG_DRIV
              Turning Left	Failed to Yield Right of Way	Inattentive	Traffic Signal	<Null>	<Null>	<Null>	Yes
- 60% are pedestrain collisions caused by Drivers fault- iattentivness & failing to give ROW

Cluster - 9 (269) & Cluster -3 conditions are same except fot DRIVER CONDITION. In cluster - 9, condition is normal while in cluster 3 inattentiveness

Cluster - 1 (275)
Mode MANOEUVER	DRIVACT	DRIVCOND	TRAFFCTL	SPEEDING	ALCOHOL	REDLIGHT	AG_DRIV
    	Going Ahead	Disobeyed Traffic Control	Normal	Traffic Signal	<Null>	<Null>	Yes	Yes
  
- Majority of impactype were 'Angle' followed by turning movement & pedestrian collision. Drivers at fault, 'DISOBEYED TRAFFIC CONTROL'. While most of drivers were at normal condition some were under influence.

Cluster - 5 (235)
Mode	MANOEUVER	DRIVACT	DRIVCOND	TRAFFCTL	SPEEDING	ALCOHOL	REDLIGHT	AG_DRIV
      	Going Ahead	Speed too Fast For Condition	Normal	No Control	Yes	<Null>	<Null>	Yes
 60% at mid-block, caused by speeding, collsions with other vehicles. Driver condition were normal for majority followed by inattentiveness. 
 So major fault is SPEED
 
 Cluster - 6 Improper turn made by driver due to inattentiveness. Pedestrains and cyclist were impacted.
