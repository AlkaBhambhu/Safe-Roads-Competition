Question:
1. Interaction terms b/w variables - for e.g. light and hour/time
2. pilot models testing few predictors at a time.
3. Use nbviewer to view interactive notebooks. Simply plug in the URL of the notebook from github.
https://nbviewer.org/
4. This query waS used to generate the Road Impediments dataset 
SELECT ROUND(Latitude, 3) As Latitude, ROUND(Longitude, 3) as Longitude, AVG(PercentOfVehicles) as PercentOfVehicles, 
AVG(AvgAcceleration) as AvgAcceleration, AVG(PercentCar) as PercentCar, AVG(PercentMPV) as PercentMPV, AVG(PercentLDT) as PercentLDT, AVG(PercentMDT) as PercentMDT, AVG(PercentHDT) as PercentHDT, AVG(PercentOther) as PercentOther
FROM `geotab-public-intelligence.UrbanInfrastructure.RoadImpediments`
WHERE City = 'Toronto'
GROUP BY ROUND(Latitude, 3), ROUND(Longitude, 3);
5. Data is being counted for long and lat rounded to 3 decimal places, because if it is done for the EXACT location of accidents 
we will have a very sparse dataset.
6. Use this to show the truncate/round to 3 degrees decision.

7. For the Heatmap, use this to compare traffic safety measures put in place:

Total - 16,860
